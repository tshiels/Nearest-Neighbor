assignments from CS141

This assignment involved the comparison in runtime complexity of merge sort vs a brute force implementation of finding the closest neighbor to a given point on a graph. The skeleton of the program was provided by the instructor. Divide and conquer algorithm and brute force algorithm were implemented by me. 

How to run: "python nearest-neighbor.py -<dc|bf|both> <input_file.txt>"
